# Simple Mobile
Ever wanted to use FoundryVTT on mobile? Now you (somewhat) can.

**SUPPORT: https://discord.gg/gs5hAgxBx3**<br>
**My Modules: http://handyfon.net/foundry-modules/**

## <b>Important:
IOS is not and will not be supported because the IOS browsers are really bad.
Some images above <u>4096x4096px</u> wont be displayed in chromium-based browsers.
I Highly recommend you to optimize image, filesizes and to use webp instead.</br>
Always try out high resolution backgrounds or those with huge filesizes before a session!</b>

## Supported Game Systems
- D&D 5e
- Pathfinder 2e
