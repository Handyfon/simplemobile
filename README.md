## [bounty on trello on league of extraordinary foundryvtt developers](https://trello.com/c/8J4ljdnW/238-uibounty-foundryvtt-simple-mobile)

This is a tentative to make foundry more mobile friendly.

Sadly this project is just to much for me, but i hope to receive some feed back from the community on this.

The starting template of this project was inspired from the marvelous project ui [Ernie's Modern UI](https://github.com/ernieayala/ernies-modern-layout)

**Manifest:**https://github.com/Handyfon/simplemobile</br>

It's always easiest to install modules from the in game add-on browser.

To install this module manually:

2.  Click "Install Module"
3.  In the "Manifest URL" field, paste the following url:
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p4535992/simplemobile/master/src/module.json`
4.  Click 'Install' and wait for installation to complete
5.  Don't forget to enable the module in game using the "Manage Module" button
